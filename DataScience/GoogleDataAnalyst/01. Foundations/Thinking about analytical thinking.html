<em>What is analytical thinking?</em> Is identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.
</p>

<p>
The five key aspects to analytical thinking are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Thinking about Analytical Thinking-Visualization"></span><strong id="Visualization">Visualization</strong>: is the graphical representation of information <em>(helps data analysts understand and explain information more effectively)</em>

<li>
<span id="Thinking about Analytical Thinking-Strategy"></span><strong id="Strategy">Strategy</strong>: it helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how to get there. It allows them to stay focused and on track.

<li>
<span id="Thinking about Analytical Thinking-Problem-orientation"></span><strong id="Problem-orientation">Problem-orientation</strong>: is about keeping the problem as the priority throughout the entire project.

<li>
<span id="Thinking about Analytical Thinking-Correlation"></span><strong id="Correlation">Correlation</strong>: is about being able to pick up and define relations in data.  <em>(Correlation does not equal causation)</em>

<li>
<span id="Thinking about Analytical Thinking-Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking"></span><strong id="Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking">Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking</strong>: is being able to see the big picture as well as the details of a problem

</ul>

<p>
Questions frequently asked by data analysts
</p>

<ol>
<li>
What is the root cause of a problem?

<li>
Where are the gaps in our process?

<li>
What did we no consider before?

</ol>
 
<p>
Use the rule of the five "why's" to reveal the root cause. This rule consists of asking five times why, once each time an answer is provided.
</p>

<p>
To identify gaps in a process the technique <span id="Thinking about Analytical Thinking-gap analysis"></span><strong id="gap analysis">gap analysis</strong> is used. It is a method for examining and evaluating how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. The steps are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Identify where you are now and where you want to be in the future

<li>
Define the gaps between the two stages

<li>
Determine how to bridge them

</ol>

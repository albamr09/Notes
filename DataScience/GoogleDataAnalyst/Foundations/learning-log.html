Also you may want to summarize each solution/option to its core idea, so it will be easier to pick up the advantages and disadvantages

The analysts asked questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result.

Next, they prepared by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys, which should be inclusive.

They processed the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, relevant, and free of errors and outliers.

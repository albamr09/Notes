<p>
<em>What does data mean to you?</em>
</p>

<p>
Now, I usually picture data like a very big table full of attributes and entries.
</p>

<p>
<em>When you come across a problem and you arenâ€™t sure of the answer or solution, what do you do?</em>
</p>

<p>
I tend to search in google for the answer of a problem
</p>

<p>
<em>How do you identify new and interesting problems to begin with? Is there a process you use to identify problems you want to solve?</em>
</p>

<p>
Generally, the problems come from me inserting myself into new technologies. This way I am more likely to come up with a new "problem" in the form of a project, for me to develop.
